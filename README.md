# Pokédex App

## Description
A pokemon profile database and search engine built with React

## Motivation
This web app was first built on 15 Jun 2020. At that time, I barely knew React and made this site with some basic frontend and REST API. Two months later, I came back with stronger skills and knowledge, and made significant update in the UI and functionality. Don't judge yourself with the lack ability to do something, jump in and discover your weakness instead.
